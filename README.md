#App Academy Course Work
This repository contains select projects that I did while working through the App Academy course. I used these projects--along with AppAcademy's open-source supplementary material (videos, homeworks, lectures)--to teach myself to work efficiently in Ruby/Rails, Javascript, Postgresql and React. More abstractly than languages and frameworks, I taught myself some of the overarching standard practices of software engineering using these resources.

Below is a summary, not in chronological order, of the projects in each subfolder:

##Data Structures (Data_structs)
 *Cache/Hashmap
    *implemented LRU Cache using a self-built Hashmap
 *Do It Yourself Abstract Data Types (DIY_ADTs)
    *implement basic datatypes such as queue, stack, and naive map
 *Knights Travails
    *Use a poly tree to solve the knight's travail problem
 *Mine Sweeper
    *implement minesweeper using a recursive clearing algorithm that clears neighboring tiles that are empty
 *TicTacToe tree
    *Used a tree to generate all possible tictactoe outcomes and made a 'super computer class' to play for best possible outcome.

##Javascript
*CSS_friends
    *styled webpage iteratively using vanilla html/css according to specs
*Asteroids Game
    *implemented the game asteroids using canvas and vanilla ES5 JS
*JQ Towers of Hanoi
    *implemented Towers of Hanoi using J-Query
*JQ lite
    *implemented the logic for a lite version of J-Query using vanilla JS 
*mail-app
    *implemented logic for frontend router using hash frags to create a mail app. 
*vanilla DOM
    *implemented logic for event listeners on /very/ basic webpage


##Object Oriented Ruby (OOP_ruby)
*Simon Game
    *met specifications for a color sequence matching game using OOD principals
*Chess
    *implemented console game of chess using OOD
*Mancala
    *met specifications for mancala using OOD

##Rails
*ActiveRecord Lite
    *implemented a lite version of ActiveRecord to get a better understanding of how it works
*ArtShare
    *created a artshare 'webapp' to learn about ActiveRecord relations
*AuthTesting
    *implemented log in and log out functionality for users with session tokens
*NinetyNineCats
    *created a spoof 'webapp' that models NinetyNineDresses, but instead of renting dresses, it's cats...
*Reddit Clone
    *created an unstyled reddit clone with cross posts, tiered comment sections, and subreddits
*URL Shortener
    *created a URL shortener that tracks the number of times a URL is visited, and other small stats.
*App Academy Times
    *frontend project where I designed a pseudo New York Times newspaper with App Academy Content according to specs
*Lite Rails
    *implemented logic for a lite version of rails using the previous Active Record Lite project and metaprogramming 

##React
*Todo App
    *created a simple Todo-list app using react components, passing many event listener functions as props to other components and making me realize that, perhaps, Redux is not such an evil thing... :^)
*Calculator
    *created a simple single component calculator 
*Minesweeper
*Widgets
    *made a few widgets, each a react component

##Test Driven Development (Rspec_TDD)
*Poker
    *implemented all the tests and code for a poker game (specs for card, hand, deck, game, and players) ~didn't quite finish! 
*Rspec Mini Project
    *implemented the tests for Towers of Hanoi and some tests/code for simple algorithms like two_sum and stock_picker


##SQL
*Polls App
    *created a rails app that seeds the db and set up associations between user, poll, question, response, and answer choices
*Movie Buff
    *wrote queries that were asked using the presetup rails database and associations
*Plays ORM
    *wrote sanitary queries to hit database according to specs
